# Weather API Integration Plan for AgMCP

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to integrate weather data into the AgMCP application UI, providing seamless access to agricultural weather information alongside existing farm management platform integrations.

## 🎯 Integration Goals

1. **Always-Available Weather:** Weather data accessible without authentication
2. **Multi-Source Selection:** Allow users to select multiple data sources (weather + farm platforms)
3. **Intelligent Context:** LLM understands which data sources to use for specific queries
4. **Field-Specific Weather:** Combine farm platform field data with weather information
5. **Agricultural Focus:** Provide spray conditions, soil data, and farming-specific insights

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Current State
```
User Query → LLM → Single Data Source (John Deere/Auravant) → Response
```

### Target State  
```
User Query → LLM → Multi-Source Context → [Weather API | Farm Platform APIs] → Unified Response
```

## 📋 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Add Weather to Integrations (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Update IntegrationsModal.tsx
**File:** `src/components/IntegrationsModal.tsx`

Add weather integration to the integrations array:

```typescript
const integrations: Integration[] = [
  {
    id: 'weather',
    name: 'Weather Data',
    description: 'Access real-time weather data, forecasts, and agricultural conditions for your fields.',
    logo: '/assets/logos/weather-logo.png',
    logoFallback: '🌤️',
    category: 'Environmental Data',
    isConnected: true, // Always connected - no auth needed
    features: [
      'Current weather conditions',
      '7-day weather forecasts',
      'Soil temperature and moisture',
      'Spray application conditions', 
      'Evapotranspiration rates',
      'Agricultural alerts and insights'
    ]
  },
  // ... existing integrations (johndeere, auravant)
]
```

#### 1.2 Create Weather Logo Asset
**File:** `public/assets/logos/weather-logo.png`
- Create clean weather icon (cloud with sun)
- Size: 64x64px minimum
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Style: Match existing logo aesthetic

### Phase 2: Multi-Source Data Selector (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Create MultiSourceSelector Component
**File:** `src/components/MultiSourceSelector.tsx`

Replace the current dropdown data source selector with a multi-select checkbox interface.

**Features:**
- Checkbox-style selection (not dropdown)
- Categorized sources (Platform vs Environmental)
- Visual indicators for selection state
- Show selection count
- Warning when no sources selected

#### 2.2 Update Chat Store
**File:** `src/stores/chatStore.ts`

Update state management for multi-source selection:

```typescript
interface ChatState {
  // Replace currentDataSource with selectedDataSources
  selectedDataSources: string[]
  
  // New methods
  setSelectedDataSources: (sources: string[]) => void
  toggleDataSource: (sourceId: string) => void
}

// Default state
const defaultSources = ['weather'] // Weather always selected by default
```

### Phase 3: LLM Weather Integration (Week 3)

#### 3.1 Add Weather Tools to MCP
**File:** `src/lib/mcp-tools.ts`

Add weather-specific tool functions:
- `get_current_weather`: Current conditions for any location
- `get_weather_forecast`: Multi-day forecasts with agricultural data
- `get_field_weather`: Weather for specific farm fields

#### 3.2 Update System Prompts
**File:** `src/lib/llm.ts`

Add weather context to system prompts with multi-source awareness.

### Phase 4: Advanced Use Cases (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Field-Specific Weather Integration
Handle queries like "What's the weather on my North Field?"
- Auto-detect field names from queries
- Fetch field boundaries from selected farm platform
- Use field center coordinates for weather data

#### 4.2 Cross-Platform Integration
- Combine weather data with farm platform data
- Weather-based operation recommendations
- Spray condition analysis for specific fields

#### 4.3 Smart Context Understanding
- Detect which platform user is referring to
- Use selected sources as context
- Fallback to primary source if ambiguous

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Scenarios

#### Basic Weather Queries
- "What's the current weather?"
- "Show me the 7-day forecast"
- "Are conditions good for spraying?"

#### Location-Specific
- "What's the weather in Iowa City?"
- "Give me the forecast for my farm location"

#### Field-Specific (Advanced)
- "What's the weather on my North Field?" (uses John Deere field data)
- "Should I spray Field 5 tomorrow?" (combines weather + field data)
- "Compare weather conditions across my fields"

#### Multi-Source Integration
- "Show me weather and equipment status" (weather + John Deere)
- "Weather forecast for my livestock areas" (weather + Auravant)
